London GitHub Users Analysis
Data Scraping Process: I used the GitHub API to collect data on users in London with over 500 followers and their top repositories, managing API rate limits through token authentication and timed pauses.

Interesting Insight: A surprising finding was the dominance of repositories in JavaScript, with most top users frequently using it, regardless of their primary focus.

Developer Recommendation: Developers looking to increase their GitHub presence might consider contributing more to open-source JavaScript projects, as this language appears to drive significant visibility and engagement.

This repository contains two main files:

users.csv: Data on GitHub users from London with over 500 followers, including their usernames, company, and other details.
repositories.csv: A list of up to 500 recent repositories for each user, including information such as language, stars, and license type.
How to Use
Clone the repository to your local environment.
Open users.csv and repositories.csv to explore user and repository details.
